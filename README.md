# CS4311_Naive_-Team-6-Sun-City-Software-_Spring2023

This is Team 6 with our own version of the Naive Project we have been working on since the fall 2022 semester.
In order to be able to run our Naive system, you will need to have the following libraries installed 
which are : React, flask , flask_cors, pymongo, and yaml.
 
Commands to install each of them go as follow:
flask : pip install flask
flask_cors: pip install flask_cors
pymongo : pip instal pymongo
yaml: pip install pyyaml


#Project description

The Naive system will allow the analyst to create and define
different network maps which show the nodes and the connections between them.
The analyst will need to login with their initials in order to start using the system,
and along with that they have three different options to create, open or delete a project.
If the analyst decided to create a new project, they will be allowed to browse the local files
in their laptop or computer in order to create the project from the INVA/DE rollup file.
If the file is chosen and there are no errors, a message will appear stating that the rollup 
cration was sucessful.
