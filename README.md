# CS4311_Naive_-Team-6-Sun-City-Software-_Spring2023

This is Team 6 with our own version of the Naive Project we have been working on since the fall 2022 semester.
In order to be able to run our Naive system, you will need to have the following libraries installed 
which are : React, flask , flask_cors, pymongo, and yaml.
 
Commands to install each of them go as follow:
flask : pip install flask
flask_cors: pip install flask_cors
pymongo : pip instal pymongo
yaml: pip install pyyaml
